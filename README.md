This used to be the release repository of Unity Ads SDK 1.5. Unity Ads SDK 1.5
is now deprecated in favor of Unity Ads SDK 2.0. Binaries for 1.5 are no longer
available and all new integrations should use Unity Ads SDK 2.0.

Unity Ads SDK 2.0
=================

First stable version of Unity Ads SDK 2.0 was released on 17th August 2016. It
is recommended that all developers using Unity Ads SDK 1.x upgrade to Unity Ads
2.0. Old integrations using Unity Ads 1.x will continue to work but Unity Ads
SDK 1.x will no longer get upgrades or bug fixes.
